            <p>
                WebEQ is an audio equalizer I created for the web. I made it
                primarily because I find audio equalizers visually interesting,
                and I wanted to add my spin to one.

            <p>
                I designed it so you can add as many control points as you want,
                giving you complete control over the audio spectrum. And I think
                it looks cool ;)
