            <p>
                SoundSeer is a project I created to visualize sound waves when
                they are combined. As I progressed with the project, I added
                more features, such as an audio player and a way to
                programmatically add patterns in the audio player.

                I'm really interested in creating visually interesting projects,
                and this is the one that truly sparked that interest. Creating
                sine waves in the HTML canvas was something I found really cool
                and still do, as you can see in my other projects.
