            <p>
                Symmetry Art is a drawing app with a twist: you can make
                intricate symmetrical designs.

                I realized that there doesn't seem to be any website that allows
                you to create symmetries with a arbitrary number of segments. I
                found this a very visually interesting and challenging project.
                I think the results are really cool.
